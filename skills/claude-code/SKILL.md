description: Turn a topic into a finished 5-minute course video on both Bilibili (16:9) and Xiaohongshu (9:16). Uses the hosted Lecturecast service at api.lecturecast.agentmesh360.com — no local rendering. Use when the user asks to "做一条课程视频 / 5 分钟讲清 X / 出一期教程 / make a course video / lecturecast about X".

# Lecturecast (cloud edition)

This skill drives the `lecturecast` CLI installed in `~/.lecturecast/app`.
All script generation, TTS, scene rendering, and subtitle burning happen on
`api.lecturecast.agentmesh360.com`. No local Docker / Playwright / Remotion
needed.

## When to use

User says any of:
- "做一条关于 X 的 5 分钟课程视频"
- "5 分钟讲清 X / 出一期 X 教程"
- "make a course video about X"
- "lecturecast about X"

Trigger only when the topic is **didactic** — a concept, technology, or
how-to. For viral / lifestyle / hook-driven short videos, use the
`/moneyprinter` skill (auto-clipped Pexels footage).

## Prerequisites

- `lecturecast` CLI on PATH (run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiyangnan/AgentMesh-Lecturecast/main/scripts/install.sh | bash` if missing)
- License key configured: `~/.lecturecast/config.toml` must have `token` set
- Active AgentMesh subscription with enough credits (50 per video)

Verify before running: `lecturecast status` — should return `ok: true`.
If not, ask the user to run `lecturecast init --key lc_live_xxx` first.

## How to run

For a typical request like "做一条关于 RAG 工作原理的 5 分钟课程视频":

```bash
lecturecast new "RAG 工作原理" --depth concept --platforms bilibili,xiaohongshu
```

The CLI is **interactive** — it will print the 7-section draft script and ask
for [Y]/[E]/[N]. **Surface the draft to the user in chat and pass their
response back to the CLI.** (You will need to break this into two CLI calls
or pipe approval via `--yes` if the user pre-approves.)

For **user-provided scripts** (recommended for science/medical/code topics):

```bash
lecturecast new "TOPIC" --script ./script.json
```

## Depth selection

| User intent | `--depth` |
|---|---|
| "讲清 X" / explain / introduce | `concept` (default, best for 5 min) |
| "深入讲 X" / how it works under the hood | `deep` |
| "动手 X" / write a X / hands-on | `hands_on` |

## Platform selection

- Default: `bilibili,xiaohongshu` (both)
- Bilibili-only: `--platforms bilibili`
- Xiaohongshu-only: `--platforms xiaohongshu`

Each video costs 50 credits regardless of platform count — the script and
voice are reused; only visual rendering doubles. Doing both is the value play.

## Voice selection

Two engines, selected with `--engine`:

- `minimax` (default) — warm, non-robotic. Default voice `male-qn-jingying`.
- `edge` — fallback engine, no extra setup. Voices like `zh-CN-YunjianNeural`
  (sober male), `zh-CN-XiaomengNeural` (gentle female).

```bash
lecturecast new "TOPIC" --engine minimax --voice male-qn-jingying   # default
lecturecast new "TOPIC" --engine edge --voice zh-CN-YunjianNeural   # Edge voice
```

The voice engine and its credentials live entirely on the server — you only pick
the engine + voice id; the CLI never handles any TTS keys.

## Output location

CLI downloads finished files to `~/lecturecast/<topic>/`:

- `<platform>.mp4`
- `cover-<platform>.png`

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| `RuntimeError: No token configured` | User needs `lecturecast init --key lc_live_xxx` |
| HTTP 401 from CLI | Token invalid/expired — re-init |
| HTTP 402 "insufficient_credits" | User out of credits — direct to `https://agentmesh360.com/account` to top up |
| Rendering takes >15 min | Server queue is congested; CLI keeps polling, no user action needed |

## Do not

- Do not attempt to run lecturecast locally without the CLI/server.
  Pre-v0.2.0 templates lived in this repo but are now in the private
  `lecturecast-server`. All rendering is server-side now.
- Do not invent prompts or scripts to bypass the API — the cost model
  depends on the server doing the LLM work.
- Do not run more than 2 concurrent `lecturecast new` calls on M1 phase
  (server worker pool is small; queue exists but UX degrades).
